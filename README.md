# AWS Terraform Projects

Welcome to my **AWS Terraform Projects** repository! This collection contains Terraform code focused on automating cloud infrastructure provisioning specifically on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. It is the result of my journey to becoming **HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate 2025**.

The projects here will guide you through creating and managing AWS resources like **EC2 instances**, **S3 buckets**, and more. If you're looking to learn and practice Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform on AWS, this repository is a great place to start!
